            <h1>Thembinkosi Manual Voko</h1>
            <p>My name is Thembinkosi Voko, and I was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, where I was raised in the vibrant township of Botshabelo in the Free State province.

                I graduated from the Central University of Technology (CUT) with a qualification in Dental Assisting, which has given me valuable skills and insights into healthcare. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Information Technology at the same institution. My studies allow me to explore the ever-evolving world of technology, focusing on programming, systems analysis, and software development.
                
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an active member of the male netball team at CUT, where I have honed my teamwork and leadership skills. I am proud to have represented CUT at the national level, showcasing our talent and determination on a larger stage.
                
                With a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems, I am committed to contributing positively to my community and beyond. I believe in the power of innovation and am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as I continue my journey in IT and sports.
